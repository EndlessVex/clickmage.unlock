This is a mod for the game Click Mage found on steam (https://store.steampowered.com/app/3228180/Click_Mage/) as I didn't like my mouse being trapped in the window.

Install is easy:

1. Install BepInEx, just grab the zip file for the latest stable release (I used 5.4.23.2) from their github: https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases

2. Unzip the file and put the contents into your click mage folder.

3. Download the mod (from the Releases)

4. Put the mod .dll file into the <Game root folder>/BepInEx/plugins

5. Start the game
